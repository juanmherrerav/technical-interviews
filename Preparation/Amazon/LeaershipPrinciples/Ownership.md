As the new process within the company did not include a delivery standard. Every time we had to make a release, production would ask us more information about the release in order ronraise their confidence level.

As i realized of this i checked with my manager and decided to make a delivery standard
A
The new delivery standard allow us to first create a process for the deliveries and then we were able to simolify the process by automating some of the steps and reduce the depenency in some tech leads wich usually did the heavy lifting

It took one full week between we closed development and Qa and production team was able to deploy to prod a new release. After 2 mlnths of imolemented the new standard the production team was able to deploy within 24 hoyra od our deliverable
