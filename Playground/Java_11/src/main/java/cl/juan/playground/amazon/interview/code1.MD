Think of a valet parking garage with a ticket vending machine which either rejects a customer because
the garage is full or gives a ticket (starting from number 1) which the customers can use later on to
pick up their cars.

Assume the garage has different lot sizes (small, medium, large) and write a program to either reject
or give tickets to the customers as they arrive.

As an example; for a garage with 1 small and 1 large parking lot; the following customer events should result in the output below:

Input: Small car – Small car – Medium car – Large car Output: Ticket 1 – Reject – Reject – Ticket 2
